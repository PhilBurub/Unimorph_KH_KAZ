Tasks:
1. Collect raw data:
    * Kazym FW
    * Western FW
    * website
2. Initial preprocessing, making UniMorph-like tsv files with all the information from the data (stem - wordform - tags)
3. Developing a universal UniMorph tagset
4. Combining all the data
5. Automatic detection of errrors:
    * finding same wordforms with different tagsets
    * finding lemmas not listed in Solovar's dictionary
6. Manual check
